Assumptions:

1. The system is designed to handle only Excel files with a specific format, and any other file format will not be supported.
2. The system assumes that the input data is correct and does not validate the data for correctness.
3. The system assumes that the uploaded file contains data for three specific sheets, namely PLANET, ROUTE, and TRAFFIC.

Core Design Considerations:

1. The system should be modular and scalable, allowing for future changes to be implemented with ease.
2. The system should have a robust error-handling mechanism to ensure that all errors are caught and handled appropriately.
3. The system should be designed with security in mind to prevent unauthorized access to the data.
4. The system should have a user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and use.
5. The system should have a logging mechanism that records all events and errors in the system for easier debugging and auditing.

Suggestions for Subsequent Releases:

1. Add support for multiple file formats, including CSV and XML.
2. Implement a data validation mechanism to ensure that the uploaded data is correct before processing it.
3. Implement an authentication and authorization mechanism to control access to the data and ensure data security.
4. Enhance the user interface to make it more intuitive and responsive, allowing for faster data entry and retrieval.
5. Add support for internationalization and localization to make the system usable in multiple languages and regions.
6. Implement a backup and recovery mechanism to prevent data loss in case of system failure or disaster.
